"""Confirm the Ending
Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).

This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced inbuilt in the python standard library. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the Python substring and slicing methods instead.

Your code should not use the built-in method .endsWith() to solve the challenge.
